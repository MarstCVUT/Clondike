Note: All scripts are located in "scripts" dir (if not mentioned otherwise)

CORE:

1) To load modules, use load.sh
2) To unload modules, use unload.sh (this will work only if there are no remote processes running on this node).
3) To start listening, use listen.sh (this will start Core node functionality)
4) To connect you can use connect.sh, but it may be done automatically via a user space director see user space tools.

FS:

Clondike relies on shared file system. Currently, it is using 9P file system for resource sharing, so it must be compiled into the kernel).
So, on all machins that will act as a core node you must start 9p server, we're currently using npfs server.

USERSPACE:

This part is not 100% and finished, but there is a prototype of user-space managing tool. This tool automatically connects to other nodes it sees and it can automatically handle migrations (non-preemptive at the moment).

To start it, goto "userspace/simple-ruby-director" and type "ruby Director.rb" (you must have ruby language interpreter installed for that)
